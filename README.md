## Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp Project II: Web Data Pipeline

For this project, I started with a data set of my choice: [Michelin restaurants](https://www.kaggle.com/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants#three-stars-michelin-restaurants.csv). I imported it, used my data wrangling skills to clean it up and built a data pipeline that processes the data and produces a result.
